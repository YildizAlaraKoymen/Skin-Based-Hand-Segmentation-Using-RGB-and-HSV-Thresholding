# Skin-Based-Hand-Segmentation-Using-RGB-and-HSV-Thresholding
Implemented hand segmentation using RGB and HSV color thresholding. Analyzed color channel histograms to detect skin pixels and apply binary masks. Evaluated segmentation results to determine the more effective color space for skin detection.
